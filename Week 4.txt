How does organization affect devops
------------------------------------------------------------
- Teams should be small, dedicated, and crossfunctional.
- They focus on 1 app
- They have all the different skills needed (infra, dev, qa, etc)
- Conways law:
Back in 1968, Melvin Conway stated, “Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will 
produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.” For example, 
if you ask four teams to build a compiler, you will get a four-pass compiler. You should not be surprised 
you got a four-pass compiler; you asked four teams to build it. If you have a user interface team, an application team, 
and a database team, you get a three-tier architecture. You should not be surprised you got a three-tier architecture;
 you asked three teams to build it. This is Conway’s Law in action.
