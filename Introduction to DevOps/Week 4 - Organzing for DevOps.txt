How does organization affect devops
------------------------------------------------------------
- Teams should be small, dedicated, and crossfunctional.
- They focus on 1 app
- They have all the different skills needed (infra, dev, qa, etc)
- Conways law:
Back in 1968, Melvin Conway stated, “Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will 
produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.” For example, 
if you ask four teams to build a compiler, you will get a four-pass compiler. You should not be surprised 
you got a four-pass compiler; you asked four teams to build it. If you have a user interface team, an application team, 
and a database team, you get a three-tier architecture. You should not be surprised you got a three-tier architecture;
 you asked three teams to build it. This is Conway’s Law in action.
- each team has its own mission aligned with the business
- teams have end to end responsibility for what they build, you build it, you own it.
- teams should have a long term mission usually around a single business domain

------------------------------------------------------------
Bad behaviour
------------------------------------------------------------
- “Bad behavior arises when you abstract people away from the consequences of their actions.” - jez humble
- silos = Bad
- allowing teams to feel the effect of their actions fosters empathy, resulting in better work
- the devops objective should be to attain a shared mindset and empower everyone to deliver customer value

Summary
------------------------------------------------------------
Organizations need to have small, dedicated, cross-functional, self-organizing teams to successfully implement DevOps. 
Conway’s Law implies that a company’s design results are a direct reflection of the company’s communication structure. 
Instead of the traditional structure organized around technology, successful DevOps teams should be organized around business domains. Each team should have its own mission that aligns with a business domain. 
DevOps is a mindset that the whole organization adopts. 
DevOps solves problems caused by siloed teams. 
DevOps is the practice of development and operations engineers working together during the entire software lifecycle, following lean and Agile principles that allow them to deliver high-quality results. 
Actions without consequences can lead to apathy. 
Allowing teams to feel the effect of their actions fosters empathy, resulting in higher-quality work. 
The organizational objective of DevOps is to attain a shared mindset and empower everyone to deliver customer value.
